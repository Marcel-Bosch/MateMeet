# MateMeet is my starter project in javascript.
When you organize a meeting with family and friends you allways end up doing maths on pieces of paper at the end of the event trying to figure out who has to pay, who owes money to who, how much money we expend in total...
My little app tries to solve this mess calculating everything for you.

You can create an event and add people to it. 
Once you have all the participants you can add expenses on each person and the app will calculate how much each person has to pay and who doesn't.

The project at the beggining started with a simple code based on ES6 javascript using classes and constructors which I've learned on my courses.
I try to play with different ways to do the same thing and evaluate which one is the most efficient. 

Future plans are to update the code to implement a few libraries to make it easier to understand and make the coding easier but I thought the beggining should be pretty vanilla to understand how javascript works and how to implement it without any additions. 

Hope that you don't find the code too messy since it's my very begginer first project and I'm doing my best :)
